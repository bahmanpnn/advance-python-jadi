# how bind a mysql of wsl to windows project and use python to connect to it==>
# way 1 (it faced with error in localhost(i think it works on servers) and must try another way)
in powershell==>wsl hostname -I ==> copy that address 
in wsl again==>sudo nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
then change bind-address with that address you got in powershell ==> save it(ctrl+x then y and enter to save the file and changes)
sudo service mariadb restart

# way 2 dont change bind-address
sudo mysql -u root
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
sudo service mariadb restart

# and done
# just remember that wsl connect to root@localhost
